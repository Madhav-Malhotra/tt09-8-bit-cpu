## How it works

We implemented [Ben Eater's CPU design](https://eater.net/8bit/) for a CPU with a word size of 8 bits. He implemented the project using breadboards. We recreated the design with VLSI. 

## How to test

It currently doesn't work so don't bother to test it :D

## External hardware

We didn't use any external hardware.
